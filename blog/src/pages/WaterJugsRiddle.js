                        How can you measure out exactly 4 liters of water?
                    </p>
                </div>



                <div className="card" style={cardStyle}><h2 className={"big-list-item"}>Solvability</h2> <p> To determine whether it is
                    possible to measure exactly *C* liters of water using two jugs with capacities of *A* and *B*
                    liters, we need to look at a few mathematical properties. The problem comes down to whether we can
                    generate *C* liters using a series of operations involving filling, emptying, and transferring water
                    between the two jugs. Mathematically, the condition for solvability depends on the concept of the
                    greatest common divisor (GCD). </p> <p> The key insight is that we can only measure a volume *C* if
                    *C* is a multiple of the GCD of *A* and *B*, and *C* does not exceed the capacity of the larger jug.
                    In simpler terms, the conditions are: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>*C* must be a multiple of GCD(*A*, *B*).</li>
                        <li>*C* must be less than or equal to the maximum of *A* and *B*.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> For example, suppose you have a 3-liter jug and a 5-liter jug. The GCD of 3 and 5 is 1.
                        Therefore, you can measure any amount of water that is a multiple of 1, as long as it does not
                        exceed 5 liters (the capacity of the larger jug). This means you can measure 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
                        liters. </p></div>

                <div className="card" style={cardStyle}><h2 className={"big-list-item"}>Exploring the Operations</h2> <p> To solve the
                    problem using these two jugs, you are allowed to perform three main operations: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Fill:</b> Fill one of the jugs to its full capacity.</li>
                        <li><b>Empty:</b> Empty the contents of one of the jugs.</li>
                        <li><b>Transfer:</b> Pour water from one jug into the other until either the first jug is empty
                            or the second jug is full.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p> These operations can be strategically used to measure the desired quantity *C*. The classic
                        example of using a 3-liter jug and a 5-liter jug to measure 4 liters shows how these operations
                        are combined. By carefully planning the sequence of actions, we can achieve the target
                        amount. </p></div>


                <div className="card" style={cardStyle}><h2 className={"big-list-item"}>Algorithmic Approach</h2> <p> We can describe a
                    systematic way to measure *C* liters: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Choose which jug to fill first and start with either the larger or the smaller jug.</li>
                        <li>Repeatedly perform the fill, empty, and transfer operations, keeping track of the amount of
                            water in both jugs.
                        </li>
                        <li>Continue until the desired amount *C* is obtained in either of the jugs.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p> A useful algorithm to use is based on the idea of expressing numbers as linear combinations.
                        According to a concept in number theory, if *d* is the GCD of *A* and *B*, then there are some
                        whole numbers *x* and *y* such that: </p> <p> *A* times *x* plus *B* times *y* equals *d*. </p>
                    <p> By scaling this equation, we can check if it is possible to express *C* as a combination of *A*
                        and *B*. This forms the mathematical basis for solving the problem. </p></div>
                <div className="card" style={cardStyle}><h2 className={"big-list-item"}>Practical Examples and Strategies</h2> <p> Letâ€™s
                    explore some practical examples to make this clearer: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Example 1:</b> You have a 4-liter jug and a 6-liter jug. Can you measure 2
                            liters? <br/> The GCD of 4 and 6 is 2. Since 2 is a multiple of the GCD and does not exceed
                            6 liters, it is possible to measure 2 liters.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Example 2:</b> You have an 8-liter jug and a 5-liter jug. Can you measure 3
                            liters? <br/> The GCD of 8 and 5 is 1. Since 3 is a multiple of 1 and is less than 8 liters,
                            you can measure 3 liters.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> By understanding these strategies and applying logical reasoning, the problem becomes an
                        interesting exercise in number theory and problem-solving. </p></div>
